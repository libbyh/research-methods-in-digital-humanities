All assignments are due at 1:50 p.m. Central time on the dates listed. All assignments must be blog posts on your own site, and you __must__ submit the URL of each post via the _Assignments_ feature on [BlackBoard](http://blackboard.iit.edu). Assignments will be graded on BlackBoard, usually within a week of submission.

All assignments are required. Every missing assignment will result in a one letter grade reduction of your final grade.

The course has four kinds of assignments:

* [Hands on Labs](#hands-on-labs)
* [Blog Posts](#blog-posts)
* [Course Reflection](#course-reflection)
* [Final Project](#final-project)

After those “labs,” you’ll have a couple exercises to complete on your own. Your labs are due before the class meeting after we practice together, and those dates are listed below.

## Hands On Lab Schedule

|Lab Name|In Class Dates|
|---|---|
|HOL #1 Analyzing Written Texts|September 12-14|
|HOL #2 Making Mashups|October 3-5|
|HOL #3 Analyzing Video Texts|October 31-Nov 2|


# Blog PostsWe’ll be using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) to house public writing assignments. In order to use Jekyll and complete these assignments, you need a GitHub account. You may use an existing GitHub account or create one just for this class. You may use your real name or a pseudonym as long as you tell me which name is yours so I can identify your contributions for grading purposes. 

## Grading Rubric for Blog Posts

The following rubric will be used for all blog posts, including reflections about the labs and the course.

| Points | Characteristics|
|---|---|
|5|_Exceptional_. The story is focused and coherently integrates examples with explanations or analysis. The story demonstrates awareness of its own limitations or implications, and it considers multiple perspectives when appropriate. The story reflects in-depth engagement with the topic.|
|4|_Satisfactory_. The story is reasonably focused, and explanations or analysis are mostly based on examples or other evidence. Fewer connections are made between ideas, and though new insights are offered, they are not fully developed. The story reflects moderate engagement with the topic.|
|3|_Underdeveloped_. The story is mostly description or summary, without consideration of alternative perspectives, and few connections are made between ideas. The story reflects passing engagement with the topic.|
|2|_Limited_. The story is unfocused, or simply rehashes previous comments, and displays no evidence of student engagement with the topic.|
|1|_Effort Credit_. Story consists of one or two disconnected sentences.|


# Course Reflection
The purpose of the course reflection assignment is to give you an opportunity to make sense of the work you’ve done this term and to demonstrate that you have thoughtfully considered how the course material may or may not be useful to you in the future. Your assignment may take many forms (e.g., prose essay, powerpoint deck, infographic, video, song).

Whatever form you choose, your reflection assignment should explain how you understand some of the topics we covered in class or how you developed (or didn’t) core media literacy concepts outlined in the syllabus. The syllabus, website, and assignment notes are all good resources for lists of concepts we covered, learning goals for each assignment, and cultural competencies. You don’t need to explain every concepts, learning goal, and competency, but you should address at least a few. I’m especially interested in competencies and concepts that were completely new or that you understand differently now. Use the whole semester; don’t just write about text analysis or video analysis.
# Final ProjectYou will individually create video that demonstrates your digital humanities research skills. You must write about your ideas for your project on the blog early in the semester, post an update on your project progress midway through the semester, and submit your video and a blog post about it at the end of the semester.

You have two interim assignments related to your final project - an idea blog post and an update blog post. The _idea post_ must explain what research question(s) you will address and provide an overview of your work plan for creating the video. The _update post_ must explain what work you have accomplished, what you have left to do, and what help you need to get it done.

## Graduate Students
Students enrolled in COM 601 have a different final project requirement. Instead of making a video, you need to write a paper. Your paper must be a draft appropriate for submission to the journal or (archival) conference of your choice. Your research project will be a replication study. You must make an appointment during office hours in September to discuss possible studies to replicate.


# Assignment Policies

## Late Policy
Late assignments will not be accepted.## A Note on Academic Honesty
Work you submit must be your own. If you submit someone else’s work as your own, you will be expelled from the course, assigned a punitive failing grade of ‘E’, and will be reported to [academichonesty@iit.edu](mailto:academichonesty@iit.edu). If you need help documenting sources appropriately, please visit the Writing Center (Siegel Hall 232-233). Refer to the [Code of Academic Honesty](http://www.iit.edu/student_affairs/handbook/information_and_regulations/code_of_academic_honesty.shtml) in the Student Handbook if you have questions.
