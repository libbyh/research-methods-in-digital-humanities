# Course Description

This course is designed for Digital Humanities majors, Technology and Humanities graduate students, and other students interested in DH research. This course will prepare you for the research and writing required in your advanced HUM classes and graduate research projects and will help you master tools (both theoretical and technical) for engaging and understanding the world around you.

To meet the major assignment requirements of the course, you will design and build an artifact of digital scholarship (e.g., a website, a movie, an interactive infographic) and write blog posts to reflect on the readings and activities. Most of our readings will be related to developing technical skills for doing digital humanities research (e.g., learning a scripting language, understanding data structures) or publications about digital humanities research (i.e., articles from academic journals).

# Learning Goals

After completing this course, you will be able to

* Describe what digital humanities means
* Discuss what data means in different contexts
* Capture, collect, and analyze a variety of data types
* Manage a digital humanities research project from end-to-end
* Write thoughtfully and critically about digital humanities research and its methods
* Construct a website using GitHub and Jekyll
* Develop a webpage, video, infographic, podcast or some other digital artifact

## Other Required Materials

Much of what we read won’t come from a book. Instead, it’ll be on blogs, in articles, and in other forms of media. Links to all required readings will be posted on the class website in time for you to read them. What we read will depend on what you’re interested in and what projects you decide to work on, so the complete list isn’t available when the semester starts.
