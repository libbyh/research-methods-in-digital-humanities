In preparation for your "making videos with iMovie" tutorial, instructor Mike DeAnda sent this info:

This (in spite of its ableist language), is a good dissection in a video essay of rhetorical devices in Taylor Swift's *Blank Spaces* music video, however, the author is not paying attention to the actual melody and use of musical arrangements in the song:

Regardless, I would encourage students to pay attention to:

1. the author's own use of pauses for his subject of study
2. what he's researched about T-Swift
3. his presentation of rhetorical terms and definitions in his video essay

And then maybe go back and see how the melody and rhythm then emphasizes and masks certain parts of the song.
