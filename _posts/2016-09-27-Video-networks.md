I hear you made it about 2/3 of the way through _Once_ on Monday, so I'm switching up the plan today. You'll finish watching _Once_ and trying to capture the speaking and association networks.

Here are some questions to think about as you look at your data and start to think about your blog posts:

- Who is/are the main character(s), if you look just at the data?
- What dyads (pairs of people) are likely to get interesting?
- Which characters do you think form a community?
- Do you think the show's "multiple world" settings will be reflected in the data? Why or why not?
- Think of another show you've seen - how do you expect it's network(s) to differ? Why?


# Other Info

I got some email questions about accessing the readings. Here are three ways to get them using their DOIs:

1. Use the [Galvin Library website](http://library.iit.edu/find/articles/search)

2. Use the library proxy

	find the article online, then insert "ezproxy.gl.iit.edu" between the domain and the first slash. Like [http://link.springer.com.ezproxy.gl.iit.edu/article/10.1007%2Fs11042-011-0725-1](http://link.springer.com.ezproxy.gl.iit.edu/article/10.1007%2Fs11042-011-0725-1)

3. Use [SciHub's Telegram bot](https://twitter.com/sci_hub/status/731467465973174273)
