Yes, this week's reading is short. Though, it's a blog post and has a bunch of links in it. Curious readers will find answers to many of their questions at those links. I especially recommend [Laudun's original post on text analytics 101](http://johnlaudun.org/20130221-text-analytics-101/).

If you have a laptop, please bring it to class on Monday. We're going to give computational text analysis a shot in class. If you have experience using Python or even the GitHub command line, even better.

Here are the Project Gutenberg books we'll be using:

- [A Study in Scarlet](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/244)
- [The Sign of the Four](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2097)
- [The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1661)
