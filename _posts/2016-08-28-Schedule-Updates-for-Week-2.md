Thanks for pointing out that I forgot about Labor Day. I've updated [the schedule]({{ site.baseurl }}/schedule) to move everything back a class period. You'll also notice new readings for later in September when we get in to analyzing texts. Remember, the citations for those readings are on the [reading list]({{site.baseurl}}/reading-list), and you should be able to hunt them down with the information available there. If not, [ask a librarian](http://library.iit.edu/help) or a class mate for help.

Your blog post for next week is not due until _before class on Wednesday, September 7th_ because of Labor Day. You should write an introduction to digital humanities for this post.

Also, I can confirm that the date info you put in your YAML front matter overrides the file name in determining how Jekyll displays the date of your post. I tested it with this one.
