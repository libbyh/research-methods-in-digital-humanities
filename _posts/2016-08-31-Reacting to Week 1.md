I've read through all the Week 1 blog posts currently visible on [your blog](https://libbyh.github.io/methods-f16/). I fixed the YAML front matter for all your posts so that everyone's author information displays properly. You can use that front matter as a template for future posts. I did _not_ fix the typos I saw, though you should probably check your work.

Here are the topics and methods I captured from your comments:

### Topics

- social media
- memes
- simulation
- trackers
- info retrieval
- digital marketing

### Methods

- network analysis
- meta-analysis
- qual
- visualization
- GIS

I will work on adding those methods to schedule for Oct and Nov. We won't get through all of them, but we can at least read about them. You may also be interested in other courses in Humanities that teach these methods in more detail, including 

- COM 383 Social Networks
- COM 424 Document Design
- COM 428 Verbal and Visual Communication
