# Class Dates: Aug 22 and 24

We're going to dive right in this week and start working on one of the central activities of digital humanities researchers - writing publicly about their work. As you know from reading the [syllabus](/research-methods-in-digital-humanities/) and [assignments](/research-methods-in-digital-humanities/assignments), you will be required to write public blog posts about your work in this class. I've specified Jekyll and GitHub pages for your blog for a few reasons:

* learning how to work with open source software
* learning how to work with [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)

Stephanie Hicks has a nice [guide to setting up Jekyll on GitHub pages](http://www.stephaniehicks.com/githubPages_tutorial/pages/githubpages-jekyll.html) that you can follow if this is your first Jekyll and/or GitHub rodeo. If this is your first time, I recommended using [jekyll-bootstrap](https://github.com/plusjade/jekyll-bootstrap) to get up and running quickly.
