Something we did today fixed the build errors GitHub was throwing. Too bad the delay is such that I don't know *what* did the fixing.

Part of the reason I asked us to review what makes for a good research question today is that I want you to get in the habit of looking for them in your readings. Here's an example from the study about shipper names:

DiGirolamo studied **ship names on Tumblr** 
because she wanted to find out **what constraints shippers place on ship names** 
in order to help her readers understand **how communities make linguistic decisions**.

What's a research question behind [Ramsay's discussion of *The Waves*](http://www.digitalhumanities.org/companion/view?docId=blackwell/9781405148641/9781405148641.xml&chunk.id=ss1-6-7&toc.depth=1&toc.id=ss1-6-7&brand=9781405148641_brand)? What about any of the readings for Wednesday?
